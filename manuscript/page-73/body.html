        <p> Jupiter takes ~12 years to go around the Sun. But it takes only 9.93 hours to spin about its own axis. A Jovian day is one-third of a day on Earth! The high speed of rotation and its gaseous-fluid make up causes Jupiter to bulge at the equator into an oblate-spheroid shape. Jupiter also has a strong magnetic field (~14 times as strong as on Earth), and it exhibits <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/61/5/003"> Aurorae </a>at its poles. </p>
        <p> Given that Jupiter is ~300 times as massive as Earth, its gravitational pull is very strong. Some scientists believe that Jupiter protects the inner solar system from long-orbit comets and stray objects like a guardian. Its gravity slings them out or gobbles them up before they can get close to us. However, Jupiter also tends to nudge a few asteroids into the inner Solar System. This increases a risk of collision with Earth or other inner planets. </p>
