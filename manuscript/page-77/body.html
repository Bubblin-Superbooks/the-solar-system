        <p class="chapter-begin">Jupiter is the largest and the most <em>influential</em> planet of our Solar System. It is called a gas giant because, well, it is made up of gases and fluids and doesn't seemingly have a rocky planetary surface. A few measurements indicate that Jupiter does have a solid core wrapped under a thick layer of metallic hydrogen but not enough data is available to establish a concrete picture yet. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_%28spacecraft%29">Juno Orbiter</a> is set to arrive on Jupiter in June next year (2016) to find answers to such questions. </p>
        <p> Jupiter is the fifth planet of our Solar System. At a distance of 483 million miles (comparatively Mars is only 142 million miles away), Jupiter receives very little light from the Sun. And it does so in no less than 43 minutes! That's the time it takes for light to travel half a billion miles. What's noteworthy here is that both Earth and Mars are closer to Sun than they are to Jupiter. There's a gap of almost 341 million miles between Mars and Jupiter â€” a zone that is also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt">Asteroid Belt</a>. </p>
