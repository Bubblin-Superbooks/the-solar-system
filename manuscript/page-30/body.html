        <p> The Sun is composed primarily of Hydrogen (74.9%) and Helium (23.8%) and a few other heavier elements (metals) like Oxygen, Carbon, Iron etc. This proportion changes over time as the Sun converts Hydrogen to Helium in its core through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion"> Nuclear Fusion. </a> </p>
        <p> Like Earth, Sun also rotates about its axis. Its sidereal rotation takes 25.05 days to complete at the equator and about 35 days at the poles. Why such a <em>differential rotation</em>? Because Sun is a molten ball of fire. The fluids near the poles move progressively slower than the fluids at the equator. </p>
        <p> Apart from sidereal rotation, the Sun along with the Solar System orbits around the Galactic Center (GC) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">Milky Way</a>. At a staggering velocity of 514,000 mph! It is estimated that a full revolution takes about 240 million terrestrial (Earth) years. </p>
