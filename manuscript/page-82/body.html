        <p> Saturn is similar to Jupiter in composition. Its atmosphere is 96% Hydrogen and 3.25% Helium followed by traces of Ammonia, Phosphene and a few other lower hydrocarbons. The interior of Saturn, unlike that of Jupiter, is known to have a solid core at its center. A rocky core enveloped in a layer of metallic hydrogen followed by molecular hydrogen transitioning gradually from liquid to gaseous state of atmosphere. NASA's space probe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">Cassini</a> is currently in orbit around Saturn for further research on the planet. </p>
