        <p class="chapter-begin">Uranus is the seventh planet of our Solar System. It is the fourth most massive planet after Neptune. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn — the gas giants — Uranus is called an <em> ice giant </em> because it contains a high percentage (>80%) of ices like water, ammonia and a few other lower hydrocarbons. Uranus is 1.8 billion miles away from the Sun and has the coldest atmosphere among all planets. In comparison Saturn is only 0.9 billion miles away. </p>
        <p> A very unique and most amazing quality of Uranus is that while most planets spin like a top on an axis nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, Uranus does so about an axis that is almost parallel to the ecliptic, like a rolling ball around a pivot. In 1986 during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2">Voyager 2</a> flyby, it was discovered that the south pole of Uranus pointed directly towards the Sun instead of the equator. This is very unusual.</p>
