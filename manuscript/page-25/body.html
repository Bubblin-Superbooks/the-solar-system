        <p> Since the mass of Earth is much smaller than that of the
			Sun <span class="math small">(M_⊕ = 0.000 003 M_☉)</span>,
			we can assume that the C.O.M of the system lies somewhere
			within the surface of the Sun, and almost coinciding with its center. </p>
		<p> Thus value of <span class="math small">{R_☉}</span> can be assumed
			negligible and value of <span class="math small">{R_⊕} + {R_☉} \approx {R_⊕}</span>.
			In other words we can assume that the Sun is fixed at the C.O.M and only Earth is
			orbiting around the Sune for all its worth. </p>
        <p> Substituting for values of mass, velocity and distance of Earth from the Sun, we get:</p>
        <p class="center math small">F_c={3.57 \times 10^{19} N}  </p>
        <p> The Gravitation pull on Earth:</p>
        <p class="center math small">F_g=\tfrac{G \times M_⊕ \times M_☉}{R_⊕^2}.</p>
        <p> Substituting values for the Gravitational constant <em>G </em>, mass and radii of both Earth and Sun: </p>
		<p class="center math small"> {F_g} \approx 3.57 \times 10^{19} N </p>
		<p> Thus:</p>
        <p class="center math small"> {F_c} = {F_g}</p>
