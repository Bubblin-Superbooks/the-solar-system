        <p>Since the mass of Earth is much smaller than that of the Sun (\(M_⊕ = 0.000 003 M_☉ \)), we can assume that the C.O.M of the system lies somewhere within the core of Sun, almost coinciding with its center. </p>
        <p> Thus value of \(R_☉ \) can be assumed negligible and value of \( {R_⊕ + R_☉} \approx {R_⊕} \). In other words we can assume that the Sun is fixed at the C.O.M and Earth is orbiting around it for all its worth. </p>
        <p> Substituting for values of mass, velocity and distance of Earth from the Sun, we get:</p>
        <p class="center"> \(F_c = 3.57 \times 10^{19} N \). </p>
        <p> The Gravitation pull on Earth is defined as:</p>
        <p class="center">\( F_g \) = \( \frac{G \times M_⊕ \times M_☉}{R_⊕^2} \)</p>
        <p> Substituting for the values of the Gravitational constant <em>G </em> and masses of both Earth and Sun, and we arrive at: </p>
        <p class="center"> \( {F_g} \approx 3.57 \times 10^{19} N \) </p>
        <p class="center">Thus \( {F_c} = {F_g} \)</p>
