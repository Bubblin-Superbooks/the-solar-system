			<p>
			First acknowledgement is to modern web for its open awesomeness that led us to the opportunity of writing this book. First salute to Dr. Colin D Wright, United Kingdom for his encouragement and insightful feedback during the early development stages of this book. </p>
			<p>
			Super grateful to my wife and cofounder who volunteered not only as my co-developer and first reader, but also as the provider of food on the table.
			</p>
			<p>
			Shout out to kind folks at Github and the developer community without whom we wouldn't have reached this milestone. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/GPUaccelerated">Astrahsis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/clemkeirua">Clement Keirua</a> and other contributors for all the awesome PRs.
			</p>
			<p>Keep it coming folks!</p>
