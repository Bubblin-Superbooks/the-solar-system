        <p>Theoretically speaking terraforming depends on many factors. Such as the scale of change warranted and its cost, availabilty of suitable technology to bring about that change, ability to travel the distance with such a catalyzing technology, ability to handle the complexity and challenges of the existing environment etc.</p>
        <p> Most scientists agree that setting up an enclosure on Moon is easier and cheaper than setting up a shop on Mars. Yet Mars might fare better when it comes to idea of terraforming because of its ability to hold an atmosphere. Moon pitches home for an outpost instead: A space station where future travelers could take a refill before re-launching further out in to space.</p>
        <p> A lot depends on how we define the scope of terraforming and the intent of these off-earth settlements. Today when terraforming is still very much a theory and we barely have the means to achieve it.</p>
