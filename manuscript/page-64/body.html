        <p> What is so inhospitable about space? How does it feel outside of our atmosphere? What would happen if we jumped into a rocket and flew out of Earth in just our tees and shorts? Here's a quick look at how one would fare in space, and how bad it could get if we were to spacewalk without a spacesuit. Even for a minute! </p>
        <p> To begin with, space is very cold. An isolated spot in the vacuum of space has an average temperature of 2.73° Kelvins (-455° Fahrenheit) only; i.e. barely above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a>. Technically speaking, space doesn't even have a temperature of its own (it is a vacuum after all). If an object is placed in space without any source of heat nearby then the temperature of this object would eventually fall to the lowest possible temperature of 2.73°K. That is cold enough for ice to be harder than steel. </p>
