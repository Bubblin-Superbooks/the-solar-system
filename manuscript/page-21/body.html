    <h4> Rotation </h4>
    <p> Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours. Rotational velocity at its equator is about 1000 mph; that's quite fast, almost matching the top speed of the latest fighterjet F-22 Raptor! Earth spins from the West to East so in relative terms it appears
      to us that the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West.</p>
    <p> The internal axis of Earth's rotation is tilted at 23.5 degrees from perpendicular to the plane of our orbit â€” a tilt that causes our seasons. </p>
