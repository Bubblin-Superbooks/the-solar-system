    <p> Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to go around the Sun. It covers a distance of about 584 million miles along its orbit in that time. The average orbital velocity of Earth thus works out to 66,500 mph. Did you know the closer a planet is to the
      Sun the higher is the orbital velocity it requires to keeps itself from falling into it? </p>
    <p>The gravitational pull between the Earth and the Sun is such that it exactly balances out with the centripetal force experienced by Earth, else we'll either fly out of the orbit or fall into the Sun. This is called <em>dynamic equilibrium</em>. </p>
    <p> Let's apply some maths to see how it works! </p>
