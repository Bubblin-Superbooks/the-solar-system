    <p class="chapter-begin"> Moon is our nearest neighbor in space. We've been to it five times! At a distance of 238,857 miles from Earth, it usually takes three days for our spaceships (rockets) to travel and land on the Moon. That's an average spaceship velocity of 3,318 mph.
      However, this isn't the fastest that our spaceships can go. Last, the quickest trip was with the New Horizons probe when it zipped past the Moon in just under 8 hours 35 minutes, clocking an average velocity of ~28,101 mph! </p>
    <p> How do we accelerate to such high speeds? Since jet propulsion can take us only so far we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist">Gravity Assist</a> to propel and sling our spaceships into orbit. This is also called gravity slingshot.

    <p>Moon is our only natural satellite. Some other planets — like Jupiter — have more than one natural satellite but we'll come to those later. Moon takes 27.32 days to go one full round around the Earth. It also rotates about its own axis in roughly
      the same time viz. 27.32 days. This is called <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/files/Synchronous_Rotation.pdf">synchronous rotation</a>, a phenomena that explains why we see only one side - the near side - of the Moon (See a visual explanation
      overleaf). </p>
