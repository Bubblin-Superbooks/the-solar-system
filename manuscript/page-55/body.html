        <p> What's unique about Mercury is its <em> tidal locking</em> with the Sun. It rotates about its own axis only three times for every two revolutions around the Sun — in what is called a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance. So a day on Mercury is very slow that lasts for 59 Earth days! </p>
        <p> Counterintuitively, even though Mercury is the closest to Sun it is still not the hottest planet in the Solar System. That prize goes to Venus. This is because Mercury lacks an atmosphere that could trap heat and raise its temperature (<a href="http://www.prothermographer.com/training/IRBasics/ir_basics.htm#heat_transfer/conduction/thermal_capacitance.htm">Thermal capacitance</a>).
        </p>
        <p> Mercury has been visited by our probes several times and it was under active observation by our space probe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER">Messenger</a> for the last ten years. The program came to an end only on 30<sup>th</sup> April, 2015. </p>
