        <p>Since the mass of Earth is much smaller than that of the Sun (\(M_⊕ = 0.000 003 M_☉ \)), we can assume that the C.O.M of the system lies somewhere within the core of Sun, almost coinciding with its center. </p>
        <p> Thus value of \(R_☉ \) can be assumed negligible and value of \( {R_⊕ + R_☉} \approx {R_⊕} \). In other words we can assume that the Sun is fixed at the C.O.M and Earth is orbiting around it for all its worth. </p>
        <p> Substituting for values of mass, velocity and distance of Earth from the Sun, we get:</p>
