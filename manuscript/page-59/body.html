        <p class="chapter-begin">Mars is the fourth and the <em>last</em> terrestial planet of our Solar System. What follows beyond Mars are the gas and ice giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — i.e. planets that do not have a solid rocky surface. Given that Mercury and Venus are inhospitable, and we couldn't possibly land on gas giants ever, Mars easily becomes a candidate of great interest to see if it can be terraformed. </p>
        <p> Mars is called the red planet because of its reddish-orange tinge off its iron ( Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%28III%29_oxide">Iron Oxide / Hematite</a> ) rich soil. It has a thin atmosphere of Carbon Dioxide (96%), Argon (1.93%) and Nitrogen (1.89%, along with some traces of Oxygen and moisture. The surface of Mars is like that of our Moon: Scarred with thousands of impact craters. It is also exposed to cosmic and solar radiation in absence of enough atmospheric resistance or a decent magnetosphere. </p>
