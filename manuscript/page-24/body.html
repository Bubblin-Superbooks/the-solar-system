    <p> Thus value of \(R_☉ \) can be assumed negligible and value of \( {R_⊕ + R_☉} \approx {R_⊕} \). In other words we can assume that the Sun is fixed at the C.O.M and Earth is orbiting around it for all its worth.
      <p>
        <p> Substituting for values of mass, velocity and distance of Earth from the Sun, we get:</p>
        <p class="centerize"> \(F_c\) = 3.57 x 10^19 N. </p>
        <p> The Gravitation pull on Earth \( F_g \) = \( \frac{(G)(M_⊕)( M_☉)}{R_⊕^2} \)</p>
        <p> Substituting for the values of the Gravitational Constant <em>G </em> and masses of both Earth and Sun, and we'll get: </p>
        <p class="centerize"> \( {F_g} \approx 3.57 \) x 10^19 N </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="centerize">Thus \( {F_c} = {F_g} \)</p>
        <p> It is highly recommended to do all calculations for the Earth - Sun system by hand. The vital stats for Earth is provided on the next page or you could google it online. </p>
