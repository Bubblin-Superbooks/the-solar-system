        <p> Distance from the Earth's center to the barycenter (point O to point X) is defined as: </p>
        <p class="center small math">  D_{barycenter} = \tfrac{M_{moon}}{ M_{moon} + M_{Earth}} \times D_{total} </p>
        <p>
            Where if the mass of the Earth were one, the mass of the Moon relative to the earth would be 0.012. Substituting for values, we get the distance from Earth's center to the barycenter of the Earth-Moon system.

			Since the radius of Earth is 3,959 miles, it means that the barycenter
			is located inside of Earth at about 1121 miles below the surface. Could anything weird happen in
			there at the level of barycenter? Well, it depends.
			Gravitational forces may loosen rocks a bit, push magmatic material up and that
			in turn could trigger an earthquake â€” but this is a conjecture not fully understood yet.
