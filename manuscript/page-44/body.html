        <h1> Projectile motion <em>is</em> orbital motionâ€¦ </h1>
        <blockquote><em>The classical motion of an object (a projectile) on a curvilinear path under influence of gravity is known as projectile motion.</em></blockquote>
        <p> Does projectile motion sound familiar? </p>
        <p> Throw a stone in the air and you'll see it fall back to Earth along a parabolic path. Throw it faster and stone will fall farther, flattening the parabolic curve wider. Keep increasing the force with which you throw the stone, and at some point you'll find out that the stone has entered a circular orbit. If you increase the force any further the stone would escape Earth's gravity and enter a hyperbolic trajectory. </p>
