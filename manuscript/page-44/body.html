    <h1> Eclipse</h1>
    <blockquote><em> An eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when a heavenly object is temporarily obscured, either by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the observer. </em></blockquote>
    <p> On Earth we get to see two kinds of eclipses: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> A Solar eclipse — in which the sun is obscured by the moon. </li>
      <li> Lunar eclipse — in which the moon appears darkened as it passes into the earth's shadow. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are three types Solar and Lunar eclipses — Total, partial and penumbral — the most dramatic being the total lunar eclipse in which Earth's shadow blackens out the moon completely.</p>
