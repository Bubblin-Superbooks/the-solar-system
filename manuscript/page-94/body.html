        <p> So far only one spacecraft, the Voyager II, has been up close with Neptune. During a 1989 flyby it was discovered that Neptune has a total of 14 moons and 3 partially formed thin planetary rings. Neptune has a violent atmosphere, with storms that span across the planet and winds in excess of 1300 mph. Structurally, it is thought to be very similar to Uranus.</p>
