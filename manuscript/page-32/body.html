												Surface of the Sun is its photosphere, followed by chromosphere and then the corona. Towards the center of Sun there is a convective zone, a tachocline, a radiative zone and then the Core â€” the seat of nuclear fusion. Temperature on Sun is thought to vary from about 3800-5800K in the photosphere to ~15.7 million K at the core. </p>
