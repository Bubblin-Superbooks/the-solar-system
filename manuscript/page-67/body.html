        <p> Since in our Solar System there is a heat source — the Sun — the coldest one could experience would depend on one's distance from the Sun. For example, a metal bar just outside the Earth's atmosphere heats up to 500°F on the side facing the Sun and cools down to -150°F on the side that is in shadow. That'd feel quite painful with a boiling hot sensation on one side and freezing cold on the other. A spacesuit balances this temperature gradient for an astronaut. </p>
        <p> Secondly, the atmospheric pressure in space is zero which leads to sudden decompression of the body upon exposure. Vacuum can lead to rapid expansion of the air in the lungs leading to a lung rupture and probable death; unless the subject exhales quickly enough. Decompression can also lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism">ebullism</a>, where low surrounding pressure causes the fluids in the body to boil and vaporize. </p>
