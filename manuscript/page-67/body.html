        <p> An interesting question about off-planet settlements is to ask which host is better for colonization. Given that human body is fragile and our resources are limited, is it better to terraform the Moon first or the Mars? We know that both are in the <i>habitable zone</i> of our Solar System and have a few things that suit the needs of humans beings. </p>
        <p> For example, Moon has the following advantages: </p>
        <ol class="rectangle-list">
            <li> Same orbit as that of Earth</li>
            <li> A manageable distance from Earth</li>
            <li> Presence of water </li>
            <li> Experience of being there before </li>
        </ol>
