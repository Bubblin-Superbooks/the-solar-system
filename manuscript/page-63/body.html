        <p> The Martian surface is very feature-rich and remarkable. It has the largest known volcano of our Solar System – <a href="">The Olympus Mons </a> - that is about 375 miles wide and ~69,000 feet high. It has a grander canyon - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valles_Marineris">The Valles Marineris</a> - that is ~2,500 miles long and up to 4 miles deep. In comparison the Grand Canyon of Arizona is only ~500 miles in length and only a mile deep. </p>
        <p> Mars has polar ice caps of water and dry ice. It is thought that Mars once had very large rivers of water but they were lost to space in absence of enough gravity and a lack of protective atmosphere.</p>
