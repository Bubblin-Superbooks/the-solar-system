        <p> Moon has a very thin atmosphere made up of mostly Argon, Helium and Hydrogen. This means that its surface is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds. It has a wide variation of temperature that goes from very hot at 107 °C during the day to very cold down to -153 °C at night.</p>
        <p> Lack of atmosphere also means that sound couldn't be heard on the Moon and the sky appears black even during the day. Here's a little science quest for you: Find out why our sky is blue in color during the day? </p>
        <p>Moon is thought to have been formed roughly 30 to 50 million years after the birth of Solar System. It is theorized that a Mars-sized object named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)">Theia</a> smashed into proto-Earth (early molten Earth) blasting off materials that later accreted into Moon. However, a clear explanation to what led formation of the Earth-Moon system is not understood yet. </p>
