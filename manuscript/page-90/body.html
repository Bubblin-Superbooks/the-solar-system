        <p> In effect, Uranus has a climate unlike that of any other planet. It's retrograde rotation at an axial tilt of over 98Â° causes one of its poles to receive more heat from the Sun than the equator. And yet for some reason it has been found that Uranus is <em>still</em> hotter at the equator than the poles. It is probable that heated materials having lighter density flow upwards the equator due to rotation of the planet. The reason for the unusual tilt of Uranus is not fully understood yet.  </p>
        <p> A common speculation is that an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus during its formative years causing its skewed orientation. More often than not, space has been found full of unexpected surprises that newtonian physics isn't always able to predict. A collision with protoplanetary object is only a speculation and may or may not be correct for the skewed rotation of Uranus. </p>
