        <h1> Europa </h1>
        <p> Among all the celestial bodies of our Solar System, Europa is perhaps the most interesting object to look at. It is very similar to Earth in composition and is only slightly smaller than our Moon (1,900 miles in diameter). Its thin crust is 62 miles deep and is made of mostly water-ice and silicious rocks. Under its icy crust, it is thought that Europa has an ocean of liquid water. Roughly three times as much water in volume as there is on Earth. </p>
        <p> One can imagine Europa like a spherical drop of water floating in sky where the outer surface is frozen. Europa has a rather tenuous atmosphere made up of molecular Oxygen. Unlike on Earth, where Oxygen is produced via plant photosynthesis, on Europa it is formed due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolysis">molecular dissociation</a> caused by radiation from Jupiter. </p>
