    <p> The heliocentric model triggered a revolution, the <em>Copernican Revolution, </em> that led to more work and many more discoveries in the field of astronomy over the next one century. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler"> Johannes Kepler </a>      (1571 - 1630), a German scientist, concluded that planets moved in elliptical orbits and not in circular or epicyclic ones. Kepler's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"> Three Laws of Planetary Motion</a> endorsed
      the physical reality of the Copernican model and corroborated it with real astronomical data.</p>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> (1564 - 1642), the father of modern observational astronomy and the father of science, discovered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus">Phases of Venus </a>      through his telescope and documented Jupiter's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons">Galilean Moons </a> for the first time. His observations supported the Copernican cosmology over its predecessors. </p>
    <p> The Copernican Revolution came to an end only when Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> (1642 - 1726) formulated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">Law of Universal Gravitation </a>      and his famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Three Laws of Motion</a>. Gravitation removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of Solar System. A point where our modern view of the Solar
      System solidified and with it dawned the age of classical physics — a <em>Scientific Revolution</em>. </p>
