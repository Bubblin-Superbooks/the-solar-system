    <p class="chapter-begin">Earth, our home, is the third and densest of planets in the Solar System. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet">terrestrial planet</a>, meaning it has a solid planetary surface. Earth is made up of mostly iron and other
      heavier elements of the <a href="http://www.ptable.com/"> periodic table. </a> About 71% of Earth's surface is covered in water, with oceans, seas, polar ice-caps etc., followed by a thin veil of atmospheric air that surrounds it and protects us
      from Solar Radiation, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray">Cosmic Rays</a> and falling objects like meteorites. </p>
    <p> It is estimated that the Earth formed around 4.54 billion (4.54×10^9) years ago and that the simplest of life-forms appeared on it about a billion years later. Even though Earth is the only planet known to host life (as we know it), search for another
      host that does or could is on. As of June, 2015 a number of potential exo-planets have been identified in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone">habitable zone </a> of faraway planetary systems. But more on that
      later. </p>
    <p> Earth has strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field">magnetic</a> and gravitational fields. It has a natural satellite, Moon, about a quarter in diameter and roughly 239,000 miles away. Moon has a great influence on Earth.
      It causes the tides, oceanic bulging and <a href="http://bowie.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggfc/tides/intro.html">tidal braking</a> — a phenomenon that slows Earth's rotational velocity and stabilizes it, and is considered critical for life. </p>
