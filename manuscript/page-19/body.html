								<p> Earth has strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field">magnetic</a> and gravitational fields. It has a natural satellite, Moon, about a quarter in diameter and roughly 239,000 miles away. Moon has a great influence on Earth. It causes the tides, oceanic bulging and <a href="http://bowie.gsfc.nasa.gov/ggfc/tides/intro.html">tidal braking</a> — a phenomenon that slows Earth's rotational velocity and stabilizes it, and is considered critical for life. </p>
								<h4> Rotation </h4>
								<p> Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours. Rotational velocity at its equator is about 1000 mph; that's quite fast, almost matching the top speed of the latest fighterjet F-22 Raptor! Earth spins from the West to East so in relative terms it appears to us that the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West.</p>
								<p> The internal axis of Earth's rotation is tilted at 23.5 degrees from perpendicular to the plane of our orbit — a tilt that causes our seasons. </p>
