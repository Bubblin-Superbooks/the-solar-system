        <p class="chapter-begin"> Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet in the Solar System, and is sometimes called Earth's <em>sister planet</em> because of its similar size and mass. It is the second most brightest object in the sky, after Moon, and is also known as the Morning or Evening Star depending on where the planet is relative to Earth. </p>
        <p> Venus orbits around the Sun every 224 days, but unlike other inner planets it rotates in the counter-clockwise direction every 243 days â€” also known as <em> retrograde rotation. </em> One explanation is that Venus might have been hit by an asteroid in the past that caused the planet to rotate in the opposite direction, but there is also a chance that Venus flipped over its poles due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_%28astronomy%29">perturbations </a> sometime during its orbital flight. </p>
