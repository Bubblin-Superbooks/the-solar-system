        <p> Mars has a very elongated orbit, i.e. eccentric elliptical orbit. This causes a wide variation in its climate as the planet moves away from or gets closer to the Sun. Mars rotates about its axis in roughly 24 hours, 37 minutes, a day that is nearly equal to that of Earth. But it takes twice as much time to go around the Sun as Earth does. Mars is also inclined at 25.19° to its orbital plane so it too, like Earth, has seasons. </p>
        <p> In fact, of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like. Only the length of a Martian season is twice of that on Earth. Surface temperature of Mars ranges from about −143 °C (−225 °F) during winters at the poles to ~35 °C (95 °F) during summer at the equator. On an average, Mars is much colder than our Antartican South Pole.</p>
