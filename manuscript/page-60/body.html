        <p class="chapter-begin"> Terraforming is a concept of applying engineering to transform a planet into an Earth-like host; especially, so that it can support human life. </p>
        <blockquote><em>to artificially transform the natural characteristics of a celestial body, or a portion of it, within a limited time-frame, so as to make it possible for independent Earth-like life to sustain indefintely. </em></blockquote>
        <p>At present, terraforming is largely a realm of science fiction but the recent climate change of Earth suggests that human beings can potentially influence on a planetary scale. Most scientists agree that terraforming can bring dead worlds to life, but the methods thought up so far to implement and transform are either technically impossible or prohibitively expensive. </p>
