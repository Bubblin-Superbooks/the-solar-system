        <p> Mars is roughly half the diameter of Earth but only a tenth its mass. Gravity on Mars is thus significantly lower, about 38% of that on Earth. It also receives much lesser sunlight (about 43% less) than we do on our planet. So far no sign of life, not even microbial, has been found on Mars. Though, a few plumes of locally ejected methane from below the surface of Mars were detected. </p>
        <p>An interesting thing about Mars is that it has two Moons: Phobos and Deimos. Imagine what fun it'd be to watch two Moons every night? But the Martian moons are small, roughly shaped rocks orbiting very close to the planet. Phobos is only 14 and Deimos is 8 miles across. Phobos is only 3,700 miles away from the surface of Mars whereas Deimos is 12,400 miles away. Compared to that our Moon is 2,160 miles in diameter and is almost 287,000 miles away from Earth. </p>
