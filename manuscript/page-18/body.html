    <p> Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to go around the Sun. It covers a distance of about 584 million miles along its orbit in that time. The average orbital velocity of Earth thus works out to 66,500 mph. Did you know the closer a planet is to the
      Sun the higher is the orbital velocity it requires to keeps itself from falling into it? </p>
