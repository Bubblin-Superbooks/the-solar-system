        <p class="chapter-begin">Neptune is the eight and farthest known planet of our Solar System. Farthest, because Pluto was struck down from the list of planets in 2006 and we haven't discovered another planet beyond Neptune so far. Neptune isn't visible without an aid, i.e. telescope. It wasn't even discovered through empirical observation like the other planets were. Neptune was discovered rather mathematically based on orbital data of Uranus alone. Unexpected changes in its orbit led <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Bouvard">Alexis Bouvard</a> to deduce that Uranus was subject to gravitational perturbation by another planet. </p>
        <p> Neptune is an ice giant just like Uranus. It contains high proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and hydrocarbons and exhibits a bright blue color due to presence of methane. It is the fourth-largest planet by volume and third-largest by mass. It takes about 165 years to go around the Sun and only 16.11 hours to spin about its axis. </p>
