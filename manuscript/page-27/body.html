    <p class="chapter-begin"> Now that we have a little primer on Gravitational Physics let's take a close look at the Sun. Sun is a star at the center of our Solar System. It doesn't look quite like other stars at night but it <em>is</em> one of them. Sun outshines all the other
      stars, rather turns our night sky into a bright sunny day!, only because it is very close to us. From an astronomical standpoint however, it is only an unremarkable young medium-sized star informally classified as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-type_main-sequence_star">Yellow Dwarf</a>.
      </p>
    <p> There are other stars that are larger, older and <em>brighter</em> than the Sun. The Sun accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Kind of explains why every planet goes around it with Sun remaining <em> nearly </em> fixed at
      the C.O.M of the system — we'd seen this earlier in our Earth-Sun gravitation model too! Sun is about as old as the Solar System (≈ 4.57 billion years) and is roughly halfway through its estimated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleocosmochronology">nucleocosmochronological</a>      lifespan. </p>
