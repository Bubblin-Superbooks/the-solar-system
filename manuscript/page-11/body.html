    <p class="chapter-begin">It took more than a thousand years and immense <em>courage</em> to figure out what our Solar System looks like, and how it works. Up until the sixteenth century only five planets were known to man. People believed that Earth was at the center of the
      Universe and that Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn turned around it in succeeding celestial spheres. Strictly in that order. </p>
    <p> This was the Geocentric model, see visual overleaf, that ancient astronomer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (c. 87-150 AD) postulated almost 1500 years before Copernicus. In 1543, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus </a>      (1473-1543), in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium">book</a> <em>De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium</em>, published a new model with a stationary Sun at the center of the other planets — the heliocentric
      model. Copernicus also put planets in their correct order i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
    <p> He argued not only that the Earth moved, but also that it moved in two different ways — diurnal motion on its axis, and annual motion around the Sun. The book soon turned into a revolution that is now considered a major event in the history of Science
      and Technology. </p>
