        <p> While Mars has following: </p>
        <ol class="rectangle-list">
            <li> Stronger gravity </li>
            <li> Nutrient rich soil </li>
            <li> An atmosphere at a reasonable pressure </li>
            <li> Presence of water, probably some in liquid form </li>
        </ol>
        <p> On the Moon, however, there is no Oxygen to breathe. Nor any land to cultivate. Moon is cold, arid and vacuum all over. Mars on the other hand has an atmosphere. But it is poisonous, with mostly Carbon Dioxide. Mars is even colder than Moon, receiving only 40% as much sunlight as we do here on Earth. Settling anywhere outside of Earth, therefore, is not going to be easy. It begs the question that if it were at all possible, wouldn't life have taken up that opportunity (in some form) already?
