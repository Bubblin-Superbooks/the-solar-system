        <p> Jupiter has a very faint ring system. This ring is not visible to an unaided eye from Earth. The Jovian rings were discovered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1">Voyager I </a> only in 1979 and are mainly made of dust particles, presumably collected from impacts, or rather rub-off of incoming comets and asteroids. The exact mechanism of how rings are formed is not understood yet. </p>
        <p> Jupiter has a total of 67 Moons in orbit around it. The four largest ones are called the Galilean moons or the Jovian satellites. They were first discovered by Galileo Galilei back in 1610 â€” a solid evidence in favor of the Copernican Heliocentric model. These moons are named Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europa. The Ganymede for a moon is larger than the planet Mercury with a diameter of 3,273 miles. It is still called a moon because it orbits a planet and not the Sun. Europa carries liquid water and Oxygen, and is therefore thought potentially life-bearing. </p>
