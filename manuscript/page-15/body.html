        <p> Today we know that there are eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, the Sun, the Moon and at least a hundred and seventy two other planetary satellites (or moons) collectively orbiting the Sun. We know that there are thousands of comets, asteriods, minor planets and other smaller objects that circle around the Sun in a state of <a class="page" href="22"> dynamic equilibrium</a>. </p>
        <p> We know the age of Solar System and how it was formed from a cloud of gas and dust. Our understanding of space has gotten better and the tools that help us watch and observe phenomena have improved considerably. We have a man-made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station">International Space Station</a> above the Earth to do science experiments. There is a giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope">Hubble telescope</a> to watch the sky just like Galileo did back in the day. </p>
