        <p class="chapter-begin"> Mercury is one of the four terrestrial planets of our Solar System. It is <em>closest</em> to the Sun, smallest in size and also the fastest planet of our Solar System. Mercury has an equatorial radius of ~1,516.0 miles only. So it's kind of comparable to our Moon in terms of size. In fact Mercury <em>is</em> quite similar to Moon in that its surface is heavily cratered, geologically inactive and that it too lacks a protective atmosphere. </p>
        <p> Unlike Moon, Mercury has a strong magnetic field indicating a molten core and a slightly thicker atmosphere because it is able to trap elements from solar wind. Mercury takes only ~88 Earth days to go around the Sun. It is fast but not surprisingly so given its proximity to the Sun. We earlier saw in our chapter on <a href="20" class="page">dynamic equilibrium</a> that the closer we're to Sun, the higher is the velocity (centripetal) we'd need to keep ourselves falling into it. </p>
