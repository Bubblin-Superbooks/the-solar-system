    <p> Mercury is one of the four terrestrial planets in our Solar System. It is the <em>closest</em> to Sun, and also the smallest in size (given that Pluto was demoted!) with an equatorial radius of just under 1,516.0 miles. Mercury is also the fastest
      planet in the Solar System, it takes roughly 88 Earth days to go around the Sun. This isn't unusual though, for we saw earlier that the closer one is to Sun, the higher is the velocity (centripetal) one requires to avoid falling into it. </p>
    <p>
    What's peculiar about Mercury, however, is its <em> tidally locked</em> motion. It rotates about its own axis only three times for every two revolutions around the Sun — in what is called a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance. So it's a very slow day on Mercury
      that lasts 59 Earth days long! </p>
    <p> Counterintuitively, even though Mercury is the closest to Sun it is still not the hottest planet in the Solar System. That prize goes to Venus. This is because Mercury lacks an atmosphere that could trap heat and raise its temperature (<a href="http://www.prothermographer.com/training/IRBasics/ir_basics.htm#heat_transfer/conduction/thermal_capacitance.htm">Thermal capacitance</a>?).
      Since Mercury lacks an atmosphere its terrain is also similar to that of our Moon, i.e. heavily cratered. </p>
